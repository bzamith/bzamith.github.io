<br>I am a BSc in Computer Engineering, working as a Software Engineer II at <a href="https://amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, in the International Technology Expansion team.
<br>
Since 2021, I'm pursuing my Masters degree at <a href="https://www.ufscar.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar)</a>, Brazil, working in the <a href="http://www.biomal.ufscar.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bioinformatics and Machine Learning group (BioMaL)</a>. My research interests lie in the application of <u>Machine Learning</u> in the <u>Natural Sciences</u>. 
<br><br>
I am passionate and continuously learning about <b>Data Science</b> and <b>Bioinformatics</b>.
Still, I am really looking forward to learning more about <u>Computer Networks</u> and <u>Natural Computing</u>.
