<br>BSc in Computer Engineering and working as a Software Engineer II at <a href="https://amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, in the International Technology Expansion team.
<br>
Since 2015, I've been developing research as part of the <a href="http://www.biomal.ufscar.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bioinformatics and Machine Learning group (BioMaL)</a>, from <a href="https://www.ufscar.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar)</a>, Brazil. I'm currently pursuing my Masters degree at this same group. 
<br><br>
My research interests lie in the application of <b>Machine Learning</b> in <b>Natural Sciences</b>. Besides that, I'm passionate and continuously learning about <u>Data Science</u>, <u>Distributed Systems</u> and <u>Natural Computing</u>.
<br><br>
In my spare time, you can find me <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93100732-bruna-zamith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading a good book</a>, riding my bicycle, enjoying a cup of coffee or (hopefully!) traveling.<br><br>
