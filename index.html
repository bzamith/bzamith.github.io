<br>I am a Master student at <a href="https://www.ufscar.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Federal University of Sao Carlos (UFSCar)</a>, Brazil, working in the <a href="http://www.biomal.ufscar.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bioinformatics and Machine Learning group</a>. My research interests lie in the application of machine learning for natural sciences. 
<br>
I am also currently working as a Software Engineer II at <a href="https://amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, in the International Technology Expansion team.
<br><br>
I am passionate and continuously learning about <b>Data Science</b> and <b>Bioinformatics</b>.
Still, I am really looking forward to learning more about <u>Computer Networks</u> and <u>Natural Computing</u>.
<br><br>
In my spare time, you can find me <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93100732-bruna-zamith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading a good book</a>, riding my bicycle, enjoying a cup of coffee or (hopefully!) traveling.<br><br>
