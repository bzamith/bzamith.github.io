### More about me
Passionate about developing research and learning different things. I have a natural inclination to Data Science, Machine Learning and Databases, due to the fact that I love extracting information from data and coming up with useful solutions. However, I am really looking forward to learning more about Software Engineering and Computer Networks. 

In my free time, you can find me drinking coffee, reading a book, riding my bicycle or (hopefully!) travelling.
