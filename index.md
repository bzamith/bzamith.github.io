### Data Science Concepts and Others
<u>1. What is the difference between Art and Science?</u>
> Science is knowledge which we understand so well that we can teach it to a computer.

*Computer Programming as an Art, Donald Knuth (1974)*

<u>2. What is Data Science?</u>

<u>3. What is Data Analysis?</u>
> Data analysis is an art [apart from Data Science]. It is not something yet that we can teach to a computer. Data analysts have many tools at their disposal, from linear regression to classification trees and even deep learning, and these tools have all been carefully taught to computers. But ultimately, a data analyst must find a way to assemble all of the tools and apply them to data to answer a relevant questionâ€”a question of interest to people.

> While a study includes developing and executing a plan for collecting data, a data analysis presumes the data have already been collected. More specifically, a study includes the development of a hypothesis or question, the designing of the data collection process (or study protocol), the collection of the data, and the analysis and interpretation of the data. Because a data analysis presumes that the data have already been collected, it includes development and refinement of a question and the process of analyzing and interpreting the data.

<u>4. What are the Epicycles of Analysis?</u>
> Develop Expectations -> Collect Data -> Match Expectations with Data
> Starting The Question -> Exploratory Data Analisys -> Model Building -> Interpret -> Communicate

*The Art of Data Science, Roger D. Peng and Elizabeth Matsui (2017)*

<u>5. What is QMV? </u>
> It is an iterative process of questioning, modeling, and validation to data analysis and model building.

*Model Building and Validation by AT&T, Online Course - Advanced Techniques for Analyzing Data*

<u>X. What is Data Mining?</u>

<u>X. What is Data Warehousing?</u>

<u>X. What is Big Data?</u>

<u>X. What is Hadoop?</u>

<u>X. What are the differences between Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithms?</u>

<u>X. What are the differences between Dynamic Programming and Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms?</u>

### More about me
I am passionate about developing research and learning different things. I have a natural inclination to **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and **Bioinformatics**, due to the fact that I love extracting information from data and coming up with useful solutions. Still, I am really looking forward to learning more about **Software Engineering** and **Computer Networks**. 

In my free time, you can find me drinking coffee, reading a book, riding my bicycle or (hopefully!) travelling.
