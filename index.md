## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.png">

Hi! My name is Bruna I am Brazilian and I have a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering from Federal University of Sao Carlos.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer @ Amazon computer. But I am also passionate and continuously learning about Data Science and Bioinformatics. Still, I am really looking forward to learning more about Computer Networks and Natural Computing.

In my spare time, you can find me reading a good book, riding my bicycle, enjoying a cup of coffee or (hopefully!) traveling.
