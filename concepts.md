## Data Science Concepts

<u>1. What is the difference between Art and Science?</u>
> Science is knowledge which we understand so well that we can teach it to a computer.

*Computer Programming as an Art, Donald Knuth (1974)*

<u>2. What is Data Science?</u>
> Multi-disciplinary field that brings together concepts from computer science, statistics/machine learning, and data analysis to understand and extract insights from the ever-increasing amounts of data. Two paradigms of data research: 1. Hypothesis-Driven (given a problem, what kind of data do we need to help solve it?); 2. Data-Driven (given some data, what interesting problems can be solved with it?). The heart of data science is to always ask questions. Always be curious about the world: 1. What can we learn from this data?; 2. What actions can we take once we find whatever it is we are looking for?

<u>3. What is the difference between Data Science and Statistics?</u>
> What differentiates data science from statistics is that data sicence is a holistic approach. We're increasingly finding data in the wild, and data scientists are involved with gathering data, massaging it into a tractable form, making it tell its story, and presenting that story to others.

*[What Is Data Science?, Mike Loukides (2010)](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-data-science)*

<u>3. What is Data Analysis?</u>
> Data analysis is an art [apart from Data Science]. It is not something yet that we can teach to a computer. Data analysts have many tools at their disposal, from linear regression to classification trees and even deep learning, and these tools have all been carefully taught to computers. But ultimately, a data analyst must find a way to assemble all of the tools and apply them to data to answer a relevant questionâ€”a question of interest to people.

> While a study includes developing and executing a plan for collecting data, a data analysis presumes the data have already been collected. More specifically, a study includes the development of a hypothesis or question, the designing of the data collection process (or study protocol), the collection of the data, and the analysis and interpretation of the data. Because a data analysis presumes that the data have already been collected, it includes development and refinement of a question and the process of analyzing and interpreting the data.

<u>4. What are the Epicycles of Analysis?</u>
> Develop Expectations -> Collect Data -> Match Expectations with Data

> Starting The Question -> Exploratory Data Analisys -> Model Building -> Interpret -> Communicate

*The Art of Data Science, Roger D. Peng and Elizabeth Matsui (2017)*

<u>5. What is QMV? </u>
> It is an iterative process of questioning, modeling, and validation to data analysis and model building.
