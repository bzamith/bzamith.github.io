## About Me

I am very passionate about developing research and learning different topics. I have a natural inclination to **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and **Bioinformatics**, due to the fact that I love extracting information from data and coming up with useful and reliable solutions. Still, I am really looking forward to learning more about **Software Engineering** and **Computer Networks**. 

In my spare time, you can find me reading a good book, riding my bicycle, enjoying a good cup of coffee or (hopefully!) travelling.
