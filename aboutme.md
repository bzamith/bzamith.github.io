## About Me

I am passionate about developing research and learning different things. I have a natural inclination to **Data Science**, **Machine Learning** and **Bioinformatics**, due to the fact that I love extracting information from data and coming up with useful solutions. Still, I am really looking forward to learning more about **Software Engineering** and **Computer Networks**. 

In my free time, you can find me drinking coffee, reading a book, riding my bicycle or (hopefully!) travelling.
