<blockquote>
  <p>Multi-disciplinary field that brings together concepts from computer science, statistics/machine learning, and data analysis to understand and extract insights from the ever-increasing amounts of data. Two paradigms of data research: 1. Hypothesis-Driven (given a problem, what kind of data do we need to help solve it?); 2. Data-Driven (given some data, what interesting problems can be solved with it?). The heart of data science is to always ask questions. Always be curious about the world: 1. What can we learn from this data?; 2. What actions can we take once we find whatever it is we are looking for?</p>

<h3 id="5-what-is-data-analysis">5. What is Data Analysis?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Data analysis is an art [apart from Data Science]. It is not something yet that we can teach to a computer. Data analysts have many tools at their disposal, from linear regression to classification trees and even deep learning, and these tools have all been carefully taught to computers. But ultimately, a data analyst must find a way to assemble all of the tools and apply them to data to answer a relevant question—a question of interest to people. […] While a study includes developing and executing a plan for collecting data, a data analysis presumes the data have already been collected. More specifically, a study includes the development of a hypothesis or question, the designing of the data collection process (or study protocol), the collection of the data, and the analysis and interpretation of the data. Because a data analysis presumes that the data have already been collected, it includes development and refinement of a question and the process of analyzing and interpreting the data.</p>

<h3 id="8-how-is-moores-law-applied-to-data">8. How is Moore’s law applied to data?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Since the early ’80s, processor speed has increased from 10 MHz to 3.6 GHz — an increase of 360 (not counting increases in word length and number of cores). But we’ve seen much bigger increases in storage capacity, on every level. RAM has moved from $1,000/MB to roughly $25/GB — a price reduction of about 40000, to say nothing of the reduction in size and increase in speed. Hitachi made the first gigabyte disk drives in 1982, weighing in at roughly 250 pounds; now terabyte drives are consumer equipment, and a 32 GB microSD card weighs about half a gram. Whether you look at bits per gram, bits per dollar, or raw capacity, storage has more than kept pace with the increase of CPU speed. The importance of Moore’s law as applied to data isn’t just geek pyrotechnics. Data expands to fill the space you have to store it. The more storage is available, the more data you will find to put into it. […] Increased storage capacity demands increased sophistication in the analysis and use of that data. That’s the foundation of data science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-data-science">What Is Data Science?; Mike Loukides (2010)</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gordon Moore (a cofounder of Intel) observed that the number of transistors in computer chips doubles roughly every two years. More transistors per chip translates to faster speeds in computer processors and more random access memory in computers, which leads to more powerful computers. This extraordinary rate of technological improvement - output doubling every two years - is likely the fastest growth in technology humanity has ever seen. Yet, since 2011, the amount of sequencing data stored in the Short Read Archive has outpaced even this incredible growth, having doubled every year.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Relational databases are designed for consistency, to support complex transactions that can easily be rolled back if any one of a complex set of operations fails. While rock-solid consistency is crucial to many applications, it’s not really necessary for the kind of analysis we’re discussing here. […] Precision has an allure, but in most data-driven applications outside of finance, that allure is deceptive. Most data analysis is comparative […]. To store huge datasets effectively, we’ve seen a new breed of databases appear. These are frequently called NoSQL databases, or Non-Relational databases […]. They group together fundamentally dissimilar products by telling you what they aren’t. Many of these databases are [..] designed to be distributed across many nodes, to provide ‘‘eventual consistency’’ but not absolute consistency, and to have very flexible schema.</p>

<h3 id="12-what-is-the-mapreduce-approach">12. What is the MapReduce approach?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Data is only useful if you can do something with it, and enormous datasets present computational problems. Google popularized the MapReduce approach, which is basically a divide-and-conquer strategy for distributing an extremely large problem across an extremely large computing cluster. In the “map” stage, a programming task is divided into a number of identical subtasks, which are then distributed across many processors; the intermediate results are then combined by a single reduce task. In hindsight, MapReduce seems like an obvious solution to Google’s biggest problem, creating large searches. It’s easy to distribute a search across thousands of processors, and then combine the results into a single set of answers. What’s less obvious is that MapReduce has proven to be widely applicable to many large data problems, ranging from search to machine learning. The most popular open source implementation of MapReduce is the Hadoop project.</p>

<h3 id="13-what-is-hadoop">13. What is Hadoop?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hadoop goes far beyond a simple MapReduce implementation (of which there are several); it’s the key component of a data platform. It incorporates HDFS, a distributed filesystem designed for the performance and reliability requirements of huge datasets; the HBase database; Hive, which lets developers explore Hadoop datasets using SQL-like queries; a high-level dataflow language called Pig; and other components. If anything can be called a one-stop information platform, Hadoop is it. Hadoop has been instrumental in enabling ‘‘agile’’ data analysis. […] Hadoop (and particularly Elastic MapReduce) make it easy to build clusters that can perform computations on long datasets quickly. Hadoop is essentially a batch system, but Hadoop Online Prototype (HOP) is an experimental project that enables stream processing. Hadoop processes data as it arrives, and delivers intermediate results in (near) real-time. Near real-time data analysis enables features like trending topics on sites like Twitter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-data-science">What Is Data Science?; Mike Loukides (2010)</a></em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Hadoop platform was designed to solve problems where you have a lot of data - perhaps a mixture of complex and structured data - and it doesn’t fit nicely into tables. It’s for situations where you want to run analytics that are deep and computationally extensive, like clustering and targeting.</p>

<h3 id="14-what-is-data-warehouse">14. What is Data Warehouse?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A “data warehouse” may be a basic operational reporting environment built from a single transactional system or it may be a cutting-edge solution uniting transactional, machine and social data to support deep and complex analysis in real time. It may provide information for daily (or monthly, or quarterly) reports or it may feed complex analysis into live business processes several times a second. […] Vincent Rainardi outlines five basic requirements that a data warehouse typically must meet: 1. An integrated view of the organization’s data for strategic analysis; 2. A consistent view of the organization’s data resources with data that has been cleared of anomalies which can lead to a false impression of the business’ function; 3. A consolidation of the organization’s data  history beyond what is retained by current operations for deep analysis of the business’ functions over time; 4. A tested and verified environment for doing data analysis to access data so that each new draw of data doesn’t become a “science experiment” in and of itself; 5. A high-performance environment for doing data analysis that does not interfere with day-to-day activity of the business.</p>

  <p>Today your business faces an unprecedented sets of challenges. Bigger data volumes. New data types. A deluge of machine data from the Internet of Things. Digital business models that require real-time performance all the time drive the need for zero-latency reporting. Data-driven businesses need more complex, more extensive, and yet paradoxically faster and more easily accessed analytics.

<blockquote>
  <p>In a very general sense, a model is something we construct to help us understand the real world. […]  The process of building a model involves imposing a specific structure on the data and creating a summary of the data. […] A statistical model serves two key purposes in a data analysis, which are to provide a quantitative summary of your data and to impose a specific structure on the population from which the data were sampled. […] At its core, a statistical model provides a description of how the world works and how the data were generated. The model is essentially an expectation of the relationships between various factors in the real world and in your dataset. What makes a model a statistical model is that it allows for some randomness in generating the data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first key element of a statistical model is data reduction. The basic idea is you want to take the original set of numbers consisting of your dataset and transform them into a smaller set of numbers. […] The process of data reduction typically ends up with a statistic. Generally speaking, a statistic is any summary of the data. The sample mean, or average, is a statistic. So is the median, the standard deviation, the maximum, the minimum, and the range. Some statistics are more or less useful than others but they are all summaries of the data.</p>

The Normal distribution is fully specified by two parameters — the mean and the standard deviation. [The Gamma distribution] has the feature that it only allows positive values, so it eliminates the problem we had with negative values with the Normal distribution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inference is one of many possible goals in data analysis. […] In general, the goal of inference is to be able to make a statement about something that is not observed, and ideally to be able to characterize any uncertainty you have about that statement. Inference is difficult because of the difference between what you are able to observe and what you ultimately want to know. [..] The language of inference can change depending on the application, but most commonly, we refer to the things we cannot observe (but want to know about) as the population or as features of the population and the data that we observe as the sample. The goal is to use the sample to somehow make a statement about the population.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Associational analyses are ones where we are looking at an association between two or more features in the presence of other potentially confounding factors. There are three classes of variables that are important to think about in an associational analysis: Outcome (the feature of your dataset that is thought to change along with your key predictor); Key predictor (often for associational analyses there is one key predictor of interest); Potential confounders (this is a large class of predictors that are both related to the key predictor and the outcome).</p>

<h3 id="25-what-is-prediction-analyses">25. What is Prediction Analyses?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the previous section we described associational analyses, where the goal is to see if a key predictor x and an outcome y are associated. But sometimes the goal is to use all of the information available to you to predict y. Furthermore, it doesn’t matter if the variables would be considered unrelated in a causal way to the outcome you want to predict because the objective is prediction, not developing an understanding about the relationships between features. With prediction models, we have outcome variables–features about which we would like to make predictions–but we typically do not make a distinction between “key predictors” and other predictors. In most cases, any predictor that might be of use in predicting the outcome would be considered in an analysis and might, a priori, be given equal weight in terms of its importance in predicting the outcome. Prediction analyses will often leave it to the prediction algorithm to determine the importance of each predictor and to determine the functional form of the model.</p>

<h3 id="26-why-is-model-tuning-relevant">26. Why is model tuning relevant?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Model tuning. A hallmark of prediction algorithms is their many tuning parameters. Sometimes these parameters can have large effects on prediction quality if they are changed and so it is important to be informed of the impact of tuning parameters for whatever algorithm you use. There is no prediction algorithm for which a single set of tuning parameters works well for all problems. Most likely, for the initial model fit, you will use “default” parameters, but these defaults may not be sufficient for your purposes. Fiddling with the tuning parameters may greatly change the quality of your predictions. It’s very important that you document the values of these tuning parameters so that the analysis can be reproduced in the future.</p>

<h3 id="27-when-to-use-inference-or-prediction">27. When to use Inference or Prediction?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>For inferential questions the goal is typically to estimate an association between a predictor of interest and the outcome. There is usually only a handful of predictors of interest (or even just one), however there are typically many potential confounding variables to consider. They key goal of modeling is to estimate an association while making sure you appropriately adjust for any potential confounders. Often, sensitivity analyses are conducted to see if associations of interest are robust to different sets of confounders. For prediction questions the goal is to identify a model that best predicts the outcome. Typically we do not place any a priori importance on the predictors, so long as they are good at predicting the outcome. There is no notion of “confounder” or “predictors of interest” because all predictors are potentially useful for predicting the outcome. Also, we often do not care about “how the model works” or telling a detailed story about the predictors. The key goal is to develop a model with good prediction skill and to estimate a reasonable error rate from the data.</p>

<h3 id="28-what-is-linear-regression">28. What is Linear Regression?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.  The overall idea of regression is to examine two things: (1) does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?  (2) Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?  These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.</p>

This includes techniques such as Bayesian methods; neural networks; inductive logic programming; explanation-based, natural language processing; decision tree; and reinforcement learning. […] Systems that have hard-coded knowledge bases will typically experience difficulties in new environments. Certain difficulties can be overcome by a system that can acquire its own knowledge. This capability is known as machine learning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Data are different symbols and characters whose meaning only becomes clear when they connect with context. Collecting and measuring observations generates data. Usually machines sent, receive and process data. The confusion between data and information often arises because information is made out of data. Data reaches a more complex level and becomes information by integrating them to a context. Information provides expertise about facts or persons. Knowledge thus describes the collected information that is available about a particular fact or a person. The knowledge of this situation makes it possible to make informed decisions and solve problems. Thus, knowledge influences the thinking and actions of people. Machines can also make decisions based on new knowledge generated by information. In order to gain knowledge, it is necessary to process information.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Descriptive statistics describe a sample. That’s pretty straightforward. You simply take a group that you’re interested in, record data about the group members, and then use summary statistics and graphs to present the group properties. With descriptive statistics, there is no uncertainty because you are describing only the people or items that you actually measure. You’re not trying to infer properties about a larger population.[…] Inferential statistics takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Because the goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions from a sample and generalize them to a population, we need to have confidence that our sample accurately reflects the population. This requirement affects our process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inferential statistics is a way to learn from data, and one of the tool of Machine Learning. Both use a set of observations to discover underlying processes or patterns, then be able to predict. If you have all the houses characteristics and prices in a given area , you can find out what is determining the price, then predict the price for a new house. Simple statistical analysis. Now if you want to build an app to predict houses prices, it’s another story. You need a lot more work, on data pre-processing, multiple algorithms, other models of regression, etc … That’s machine learning territory. Inferential statistics is only one of the tool. Machine Learning also wants to learn from “big data”, high dimensional data, unstructured, streaming data, find connexions in a social network, group press releases by similar topics, recognize images, compress pictures etc. No nice excel-like data set for this. It requires a different set of tools (whose goal is basically to turn everything the messy world is throwing at us into a nice excel-like data set with matrices that compute fast). The techniques that deal with high dimensional and streaming data have all the attention today, but a lot of the implementations of Machine Learning are still classic regression. You hear a lot that a business can be “moneyballed”, referring to base ball statistics. The idea is that you can take something that is “obviously” not data driven (“I have been doing this business for 30 years and let me tell you it’s all about connecting with people”), and prove that it can be run more effectively with data. Most of that is indeed inferential statistics, plus additional techniques. It’s all “learning from data”.</p>

<h3 id="42-what-is-the-bias-variance-trade-off">42. What is the bias-variance trade-off?</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Bias is the difference between the average prediction of our model and the correct value which we are trying to predict. Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It always leads to high error on training and test data. Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasn’t seen before. As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data. If our model is too simple and has very few parameters then it may have high bias and low variance. On the other hand if our model has large number of parameters then it’s going to have high variance and low bias. So we need to find the right/good balance without overfitting and underfitting the data. This tradeoff in complexity is why there is a tradeoff between bias and variance. An algorithm can’t be more complex and less complex at the same time.</p>

Also, these kind of models are very simple to capture the complex patterns in data like Linear and logistic regression.</p>
